    &lt;span>&lt;strong>Heuristic Evaluation&lt;/strong> - a method developed by Nielsen that suggests an evaluation by HCI&#xD;
    specialists with experience in this type of evaluation, it also recommends that the inspection must be performed by a&#xD;
    number of three to five evaluators with the purpose of identifying the greatest number of usability problems. Heuristic&#xD;
    Evaluation is a usability inspection method and follows a set of 10 principles e.g. consistency, flexibility and&#xD;
    efficiencies, for which the evaluator fills a heuristic checklist containing the annotations of the problems&#xD;
    encountered. In the Usa-DSL Process this inspection will be conducted through a Heuristic Checklist composed by a&#xD;
    structure which consists of five (5) columns: the first column contains the identification of the heuristic, the second&#xD;
    column is related to the description of the ten (10) Nielsen's heuristics, but adapted to the context of DSLs, the&#xD;
    third column refers to the questions that guide the evaluation and related to each one of the heuristics, the fourth&#xD;
    column is the severity degree of the usability problems found and the fifth column is designed for the description of&#xD;
    issues found in the DSLs.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    P1a&lt;/a>)&lt;/span>&lt;span>, provided as they know the language domain. These tests can be applied in a controlled&#xD;
    environment or in the natural environment, always respecting the chosen&lt;/span> &lt;span>Empirical Study&#xD;
    Method&lt;/span>&lt;span>. The evaluated metrics can be ease of use, task error rates, completion rate, effort, learning,&#xD;
    efficiency and effectiveness; these metrics generate data that can be recorded in videos, facial expressions, mouse&#xD;
    movements, and typed keys that are recorded in a log. They can also be obtained through Checklists, Questionnaires,&#xD;
    Interviews or Use Observation.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&#xD;
