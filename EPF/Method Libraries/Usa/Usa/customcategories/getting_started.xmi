    &lt;span>What is Usa-DSL Process?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>Usa-DSL Process is a Usability Evaluation Process for Specific Domain Language that, over time, is expected to&#xD;
    cover a broad set of needs of DSL developers with regard to evaluation of DSLs. Usa-DSL Process Usa-DSL Process&#xD;
    searches through its concepts to assist in the evaluation of the quality of the DSLs that will be delivered and used by&#xD;
    end-users.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>Usa-DSL is characterized by four mutually supporting fundamental principles:&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;em>&lt;span>Assist in the construction of the usability evaluation in a practical and efficient way.&lt;/span>&lt;/em>&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;em>&lt;span>Assist in the DSL development through continuous feedback, promoting to continuous improvement of the&#xD;
            language.&lt;/span>&lt;/em>&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;em>&lt;span>Focus on the user-centered evaluation through all the construction phases, minimizing the DSL's&#xD;
            rework and disuse.&lt;/span>&lt;/em>&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
        &lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;em>&lt;span>Make DSLs evaluation easier and productive, aiming to reach usability criteria and usage&#xD;
            satisfaction&lt;/span>&lt;/em>&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;br dir=&quot;ltr&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>The main purpose of the Usa-DSL Process is to guide the questions &quot;Who will do what, when and how?&quot; [Pre10],&#xD;
    always iteratively [SJWM05] and guided to the development of formal usability evaluations with ease and&#xD;
    speed.&lt;/span>&lt;span>Its main objective is to provide the procedures to perform the evaluation regarding the usability of&#xD;
    Dsls, verifying through methods, techniques and activities how these languages meet the quality of use&#xD;
    issues.&lt;/span>&lt;span>The Usa-DSL Process deals with the elaboration of usability evaluations involving the methods&#xD;
    Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Testing[Nie93], with the intention of systematizing and developing the evaluations&#xD;
    in a productive way and with less cost.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>The Usa-DSL Process has a structure composed of method content (Method Content) and process (Process). Method&#xD;
    Content is a knowledge base, in which the information that will be consumed by the process is stored.The information&#xD;
    stored in Method Content is organized into Work Products, Tasks, Profiles, Profile Set and Steps. The Process deals&#xD;
    with the organization of the elements of the Method Content, relating this elements in sequence partially ordered and&#xD;
    customized for each specific project. Process has basic structural elements such as: Phases, Activities, Profiles Use,&#xD;
    Task Use, Use Work Products Use. Usa-DSL contains a category of grouping elements that is intended for Guidelines, that&#xD;
    is, templates for documents that will be consumed, generated or modified throughout the life cycle. These templates&#xD;
    will be used by both the method content and the process, they are described in a unique way. The Usa-DSL Process has&#xD;
    several artifacts of this type that can be used during the execution of a task and/or the process generated, are:&#xD;
    Informed Consent Term, Profile Questionnaire, Usability Questionnaire, Heuristic Checklist, Glossary, Documentation,&#xD;
    DSL Guide, Use Scenario, Training Documentation DSL, Study Protocol among others.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>&lt;span>&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/span>&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>Who should use Usa-DSL Process?&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>&lt;strong>Profile&lt;/strong> - is an element of Method Content that defines the roles played within the&#xD;
    process.&lt;/span>&lt;span>Profiles are used to define who executes each Task, as well as to define those responsible for a&#xD;
    set of Work Products that make up the Usa-DSL Process.&lt;/span>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>The Usa-DSL Process defines eight (8) Profiles, which were grouped into three (3) Profiles Set, in which they&#xD;
    were grouped by type of execution, are:&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            &lt;span>Process Executors: this set of Profiles brings together Usa-DSL Process users, that is, who plans and&#xD;
            conducts the reviews.&lt;/span>&lt;span>These profiles are part of the group that designs, develops and has interest&#xD;
            in evaluating DSL, are: DSL Analyst, DSL Developer and DSL Tester;&lt;/span>&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            &lt;span>Usability Evaluation Subjects: this set of Profiles brings together the Domain Analyst, Domain Developer,&#xD;
            Domain Tester and End User, that is, the people who will be invited to participate in the&#xD;
            evaluation.&lt;/span>&lt;span>Those who will contribute to the DSL developers, pointing out the improvements or&#xD;
            corrections that must be made to achieve a more enjoyable user experience;&lt;/span>&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div>&#xD;
            &lt;span>HeurÃ­stic Evaluation Subjects: This Profile is composed only of HCI Expert, the heuristic evaluation&#xD;
            expert.&lt;/span>&lt;span>These participants aim to evaluate the DSL and contribute to the group of developers from&#xD;
            the errors and degree of severity pointed out during the evaluation, seeking to improve usability and user&#xD;
            experience before presenting the DSL to users.&lt;/span>&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>How do I get started?&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>Start by understanding the core principles of the Usa-DSL Process, then understand how the process works and what&#xD;
    your goals are.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>After understanding these concepts understand the role of each profile in the execution of the process.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span>Understood these concepts you need to appropriate the concepts related to each Usability Evaluation that the&#xD;
    Process makes available, and from this information select the type of usability evaluation that best meets the need for&#xD;
    evaluation of your DSL.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
